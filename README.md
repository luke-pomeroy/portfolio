# My portfolio at [**lukepomeroy.co.uk**](https://lukepomeroy.co.uk)
My portfolio website was built using Django, HTML5 and CSS. My resume and projects featured on this site are stored in a SQLite database and utilise the Django ORM and template engine to dynamically populate the page.
The website is hosted on an Oracle Cloud Instance.

## ToDo
- [ ] Add multiple images in a gallery to projects pop-up modal
- [ ] Add separate project pages
